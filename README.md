this is a simple c# Application that gets a string as the password and shows how 
strong the password is. It also shows what the issues are with the given 
password. The power of password will be calculated as below:
• Have symbols and punctuation characters: 15 points
• Have letters: 15 points
• Have numbers: 10 points
• The length of the password be 15 or more: 75 points
• The length of the password be between 10 to 14 : 60 points
• The length of the password be between 7 to 9: 40 points
• The length of the password be less than 7 and more than 4: 20 points
Now, if the power of the password be:
• Equal or more than 90, Password is Very Strong
• Between 75 and 89, Password is Strong
• Between 50 and 74, Password is Medium
• Between 25 and 49, Password is Weak
